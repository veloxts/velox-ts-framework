            Review this pull request for the VeloxTS TypeScript framework.

            Focus on:
            1. TypeScript type safety - ensure no `any`, `as any`, `@ts-ignore`, or `@ts-expect-error`
            2. Code quality and maintainability
            3. Adherence to conventions documented in CLAUDE.md
            4. API design consistency with Laravel-inspired patterns
            5. Proper error handling
            6. Test coverage for new functionality

            The project uses:
            - TypeScript strict mode
            - Zod for validation
            - Prisma 7 with driver adapters
            - tRPC + auto-generated REST endpoints
            - Fastify as the HTTP server

            Provide actionable feedback with specific line references.

# Contributing to VeloxTS

Thank you for your interest in VeloxTS!

## Current Status: Early Development

VeloxTS is currently in **early preview (v0.6.x)** and under active development by a small core team. While the repository is public, **we are not yet accepting external contributions**.

### What This Means

- **Pull Requests**: We are not reviewing or merging external PRs at this time
- **Issues**: Please hold off on opening issues—the API is still evolving rapidly
- **Discussions**: Feel free to star the repo and watch for updates

### Why?

The framework's core architecture and APIs are still being refined. Accepting contributions now would create merge conflicts and maintenance burden as we make breaking changes. We want to reach a stable foundation before opening up to the community.

### When Will This Change?

We plan to open contributions after:
- [ ] v1.0 release with stable APIs
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Contribution guidelines established

### Stay Updated

- Star this repository to show interest
- Watch for releases to be notified of v1.0

*This policy will be updated when we're ready to accept contributions. Thank you for your patience!*

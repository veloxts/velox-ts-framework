description: Ensure your app is ready for production.

Complete this checklist before deploying to production.

## Environment

- [ ] `NODE_ENV=production` is set
- [ ] All secrets are secure (not committed to git)
- [ ] Environment variables are configured on host

## Security

- [ ] JWT secrets are 32+ characters
- [ ] Database credentials are secure
- [ ] CORS origins are restricted (not `*`)
- [ ] Rate limiting is enabled on auth endpoints
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced

## Database

- [ ] Production database URL is configured
- [ ] Connection pooling is appropriate
- [ ] Migrations are run: `pnpm prisma migrate deploy`
- [ ] Backups are configured

## Performance

- [ ] Build is optimized: `pnpm build`
- [ ] Unnecessary dev dependencies removed
- [ ] Logging level is appropriate

## Monitoring

- [ ] Health check endpoint works: `/api/health`
- [ ] Error tracking is configured (Sentry, etc.)
- [ ] Logging aggregation is set up

## Graceful Shutdown

```typescript
const shutdown = async () => {
  await prisma.$disconnect();
  process.exit(0);
};

process.on('SIGTERM', shutdown);
process.on('SIGINT', shutdown);
```

## Health Endpoint

```typescript
health: procedure()
  .output(z.object({ status: z.string(), timestamp: z.string() }))
  .query(() => ({
    status: 'ok',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  })),
```

## Next Steps

- [Docker](/docs/deployment/docker/) - Container deployment
- [Railway](/docs/deployment/railway/) - PaaS deployment

description: What is VeloxTS and why you should use it.

VeloxTS (the **TS** stands for **TypeScript**) is a full-stack TypeScript framework designed to provide good developer experience (DX) and end-to-end type safety.

## Philosophy

VeloxTS is built on four core principles:

1. **Type Safety Without Code Generation** - types flow through direct imports. No build-time code generation required.

2. **Hybrid API Architecture** - A single procedure definition serves both tRPC (for type-safe internal calls) and REST (for external API consumers).

3. **Convention Over Configuration** - Sensible defaults with escape hatches. Naming conventions automatically generate routes.

4. **Opinionated & Productive** - Expressive syntax, batteries included, progressive disclosure of complexity.

## What You Get

- **@veloxts/core** - Fastify wrapper, plugin system, dependency injection
- **@veloxts/router** - Procedure-based API with tRPC + REST adapter
- **@veloxts/validation** - Zod integration for schema validation
- **@veloxts/orm** - Prisma wrapper with enhanced DX
- **@veloxts/auth** - JWT, sessions, guards, policies, rate limiting
- **@veloxts/client** - Type-safe frontend API client
- **@veloxts/cli** - Development server, code generators, database tools
- **@veloxts/web** - React Server Components with Vinxi

Plus ecosystem packages: cache, queue, mail, storage, scheduler, events.

## Two Architectures, One Framework

VeloxTS gives you a real architectural choice upfront. Both paths share the same backend foundation—procedures, validation, database patterns—but differ in how your web app is rendered and where it lives. One runs entirely in the browser, the other leverages React Server Components for server-side rendering. Pick the approach that fits your project:

### API + SPA (Simpler)

A classic architecture with a **Fastify** backend and a separate **React SPA** frontend. The backend handles API logic, the frontend is a standard Vite-powered Single Page Application. Great for teams with separate frontend/backend concerns or when integrating with existing React apps.

**Templates:** `default`, `--auth`, `--trpc`

### API + RSC (React Server Components)

A unified architecture using **Vinxi** and **React Server Components**. Server actions bridge directly to your procedures, enabling seamless data fetching without client-side API calls. Ideal for solo developers or teams wanting server-side rendering and a tighter integration between UI and data.

**Templates:** `--rsc`, `--rsc-auth`

Both approaches share the same backend patterns (procedures, validation, database) - only the frontend architecture differs.
